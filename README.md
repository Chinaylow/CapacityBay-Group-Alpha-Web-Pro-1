# CapacityBay-Group-Alpha-Web-Pro-1
This project was done by CapacityBay Group Alpha. The group comprises of 7 people.
The whole project was put together by Chinelo, Tomilola, Elizabeth and Bright. The project was divided into 5; Chinelo created the landing page.
Elizabeth worked on the heading and image on the webpage. 
Tomilola worked on the 6 boxes, designed it and made it responsive as well.
Bright sourced the colours used on the webpage and also created the Nav bar.
Chinelo did the final touches and voila We did it.
Our appreciation goes to our faculties, they did a great job on us.
